# Portfolio Generator

## Description
This is a command-line tool used to generate an entire portfolio webpage for a developer based on user input. Once the user enters their developer information and projects, it asynchronously generates an HTML page containing the resulting portfolio. Uses Node.js, inquirer, asynchronous fs, and bootstrap.

## Usage
Clone the repository and use ``` node app ``` to run the application. Fill out your developer and project information according to the prompts as they are listed. Once the application has finished running, the generated portfolio's HTML file and css stylesheet will be located in the dist directory.
